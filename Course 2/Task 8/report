Model Evaluation Report: Gradient Boosting Classifier
1. Baseline Model (Untuned)
Accuracy: 0.799
Class 1 Recall: 0.01
Observation: The model performs well for class 0 (majority class) but almost fails to detect class 1 (minority class), highlighting a severe class imbalance issue.

2. Tuned Model via GridSearchCV
Best Params: max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=3, min_samples_split=7, max_features='sqrt'
accuracy: 0.802
Class 1 Recall: 0.01
Observation: Grid search slightly improved accuracy (~0.3%), but recall for the minority class remained very low. No substantial gain over the baseline.

3. SMOTE + RandomizedSearchCV
Sampling: SMOTE applied to balance the training set
Best Params: Randomly chosen via 20-iteration randomized search
Accuracy: 0.790
Class 1 Recall: 0.02 (slight improvement)
Observation: Despite class balancing, the overall accuracy slightly dropped and performance on class 1 remained poor. Indicates the model is still biased towards the majority class.

Summary
All models struggle significantly with detecting the minority class.
Hyperparameter tuning marginally improved results but did not solve the imbalance issue.
SMOTE had limited effect, suggesting the model may need alternative strategies (e.g., XGBoost, class-weight adjustment, cost-sensitive learning).
